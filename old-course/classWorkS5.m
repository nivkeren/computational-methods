% plots

% The script temps.m (attached) prepares a vector called
% 'temperature' with the max temperatures from three 
% different places measured during a month (Jan 2017, Beit Dagan, Jerusalem and Mitzpe Ramon).

% load the data to Workspace

% plot the three temperature vectors, for each site, on the same figure

% add labels to the axes: 'Day' and 'temperature [C]'

% We can calculate the mean temperature
% at the three locations with the function 'mean' 
% (like most similar functions, 'mean' calculates means of columns
% by default, but it can be changed - read 'doc mean')

% calculate the mean for each site (you can store it in the same variable)

% add to the figure a dashed line for each location, that shows the average temperature.

% use the function 'median' for calculate the median of each site ('hetzion'),

% plot it with a different line (not a dashed line) on the same plot.

% *more things to do:
% add legend, add title, add grid...
